Welcome to LaunchBox for MS-DOS Special Edition 2.0!

This application is a launcher that will allow you to manage and launch all
your MS-DOS applications (eh, who are we kidding, GAMES). You can launch your
games with it.

To use it, simply navigate to the folder where you've placed the files (the
same folder where this README file is), and run LAUNCH.BAT.

For example:

C:
CD \LAUNCHBX
LAUNCH.BAT

Happy gaming!
